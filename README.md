# discord-bot-MBot
A discord bot, namely MBot, implemented using Python

This is one of my first projects. Considering this and the fact that I have written it in highschool, the code could be a little messy and especially non-modular.
However, I had put a great effort in this project in highschool and it enabled me improve myself a lot in algorithmic thinking.
